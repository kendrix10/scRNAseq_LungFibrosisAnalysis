# scRNAseq_LungFibrosisAnalysis
This repository describes the processing and analysis steps taken to uncover the role of potential biomarker, ANTXR1 in the progression and resolution of fibrosis in murine lungs.

The datasets that are used here are: [GSE250396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE250396), [GSE264162](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi), [GSE264278](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi). We are interested in exploring the changes that occur globally and genetically in the single-cell resolution over time. We hypothesize that the change in ANTXR1 expression can be correlated with changes with lung fibroblasts, which are determined to be the affected cell type in triggering fibrotic repair mechanisms during the course of injury.
