This repository describes the preprocessing and analysis steps taken to uncover the role of a potential biomarker, ANTXR1 in the progression and resolution of fibrosis in lungs.

The datasets that are used here are: [GSE250396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE250396), [GSE264162](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi), [GSE264278](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi). We are interested in exploring the changes that occur globally and genetically in the single-cell resolution over time. We hypothesize that the change in ANTXR1 expression can be correlated with changes with lung fibroblasts, which are determined to be the affected cell type in triggering fibrotic repair mechanisms during the course of injury. 

I start by exploring publicly available bleomycin model murine time-series datasets through [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and [OmicsDI](https://www.omicsdi.org/database). To save time and compute, I use the count matrices that are made available on these databases and interrogate the quality of these matrices through the standard Seurat preprocessing pipeline - noting cell counts, UMI and cell complexities to determine if the datasets provide viable cells to be interogated across multiple timepoints for my analysis. 

The counts are normalized, SCTransformed and clustered. Cell typing is done through Azimuth using [LungRef v2.0](https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/#Human%20-%20Lung%20v2%20%28HLCA%29), with validation done using a separate marker-based annotation algorithm, [ScType](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28803-w). Output files are saved as preprocessed_seurat_obj and are analysed in the Analysis files for each dataset. 

The datasets are analysed separately due to the confluence of technical artifacts that cannot be integrated. Running a PCA on the cells at the same/similar timepoints show very clear batch effects. In any case, it is not advised to integrate datasets with very clear technical variability and batch effects together. In any case, we see clear correlative but delayed effects between the expression of ANTXR1 in fibroblasts in both level of expression and percentage of ANTXR1-expressing cells to the expression of collagen (here serving as a proxy for the degree of fibrotic burden expressed by the cells). While this preliminary findings show promising results, this work-in-progress highlights the importance of further exploration in uncovering more direct effects of this gene on the global fibrotic changes in the cells.
